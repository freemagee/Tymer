## Notes

*This is a legacy project.* Originally created in May 15, 2013. I have made changes over the years, mainly from a technology perspective. There is a React ([React Without JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html)) branch. But that branch was unfinished.

The master has recently been updated to fix a bug. I took the liberty to fix some other issues as well so that even though it is an older technology, it still works.

I have learnt a lot since I created this project and sometimes it is good to look back at how you used to work, so that you can appreciate where you are now.
